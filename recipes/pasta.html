  <h1>Pasta</h1>

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This homemade pasta recipe is our new favorite cooking project! Lately, Jack and I have been spending even more time than usual in the kitchen, experimenting with bread, baked goods, and even okonomiyaki. 
    But we keep coming back to homemade pasta. Itâ€™s super fun to make together, and it only requires a handful of basic ingredients. Of course, the fact that itâ€™s absolutely delicious doesnâ€™t hurt either. ðŸ™‚
    My homemade pasta recipe refers to the pasta maker attachment for the KitchenAid Stand Mixer, which is how we roll out our fresh pasta at home. If you donâ€™t have a KitchenAid, donâ€™t worry! 
    You could also roll out this pasta dough according to the instructions on a regular pasta maker.
     However you make it, I hope you try this recipe. Itâ€™s an easy, fun way to spend an hour in the kitchen with someone you love, and at the end, you get to eat a big plate of chewy noodles with a perfect al dente bite.</p>
